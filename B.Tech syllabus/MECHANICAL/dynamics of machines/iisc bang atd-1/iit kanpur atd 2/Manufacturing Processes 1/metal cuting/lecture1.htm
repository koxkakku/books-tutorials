    <p align="justify" class="style33" ><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  > Virtually nothing moves, turns, rolls, or flies without the benefit of cast metal products. The metal casting industry plays a key role in all the major sectors of our economy. There are castings in locomotives, cars trucks, aircraft, office buildings, factories, schools, and homes. <a href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('fig0.htm','fig0','scrollbars=yes,width=680,height=400')">Figure0 </a> some metal cast parts. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >Metal Casting is one of the oldest materials shaping methods known. Casting means pouring molten metal into a mold with a cavity of the shape to be made, and allowing it to solidify. When solidified, the desired metal object is taken out from the mold either by breaking the mold or taking the mold apart. The solidified object is called the casting. By this process, intricate parts can be given strength and rigidity frequently not obtainable by any other manufacturing process.&nbsp; The mold, into which the metal is poured, is made of some heat resisting material. Sand is most often used as it resists the high temperature of the molten metal. Permanent molds of metal can also be used to cast products. </p>

      <p align="justify"  style='line-height:150%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;'><b>Advantages </b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >The metal casting process is extensively used in manufacturing because of its many advantages. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molten material can flow into very small sections so that intricate shapes can be made by this process. As a result, many other &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operations, such as machining, forging, and welding, can be minimized or eliminated. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to cast practically any material that is ferrous or non-ferrous. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the metal can be placed exactly where it is required, large saving in weight can be achieved. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessary tools required for casting molds are very simple and inexpensive. As a result, for production of a small lot, it is the ideal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain parts made from metals and alloys that can only be processed this way.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size and weight of the product is not a limitation for the casting process.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  ><b>Limitations</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the castings made by sand casting processes are a limitation to this technique. Many new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casting processes have been developed which can take into consideration the aspects of dimensional accuracy and surface finish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these processes are die casting process, investment casting process, vacuum-sealed molding process, and shell molding &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal casting process is a labor intensive process</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33" ><b>History</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >Casting technology, according to biblical records, reaches back almost 5,000 years BC. Gold, pure in nature, most likely caught Prehistoric man's fancy.as he probably hammered gold ornaments out of the gold nuggets he found. Silver would have been treated similarly. Mankind next found copper, because it appeared in the ash of his camp fires from copper-bearing ore that he lined his fire pits with. Man soon found that copper was harder than gold or silver. Copper did not bend up when used. So copper, found a 'nitch' in man's early tools, and then marched it's way into Weaponry. But, long before all this.man found clay. So he made pottery - something to eat from. Then he thought, &quot;now.what else can I do with this mud.&quot; . Early man thought about it, &quot;they used this pottery stuff, ( the first patterns ), to shape metal into bowls &quot;.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  ><b>3200 B.C.</b> A copper frog, the oldest known casting in existence, is cast in Mesopotamia.<br>
          <br>
          <b>233 B.C.</b> Cast iron plowshares are poured in China.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >          <b>500 A.D.</b> Cast crucible steel is first produced in India, but the process is lost until 1750, when Benjamin Huntsman reinvents it in England.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  ><b>1455</b> Dillenburg Castle in Germany is the first to use cast iron pipe to transport water.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1480</b> Birth of Vannoccio Biringuccio (1480-1539), the &quot;father of the foundry industry,&quot; in Italy. He is the first man to document the foundry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process in writing.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >          <b>1709</b> Englishman Abraham Darby creates the first true foundry flask for sand and loam molding.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >          <b>1750</b> Benjamin Huntsman reinvents the process of cast crucible steel in England. This process is the first in which the steel is completely &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;melted, producing a uniform composition within the melt. Since the metal is completely molten, it also allows for alloy steel production, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the additional elements in the alloy can be added to the crucible during melting. Prior steel production was accomplished by a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combination of forging and tempering, and the metal never reached a molten state.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >          <b>1809</b> Centrifugal casting is developed by A. G. Eckhardt of Soho, England. </p>
