      <p class="style33"  ><b>Molding Material and Properties</b></p>      
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >A large variety of molding materials is used in foundries for manufacturing molds and cores. They include molding sand, system sand or backing sand, facing sand, parting sand, and core sand. The choice of molding materials is based on their processing properties. The properties that are generally required in molding materials are: </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  ><b>Refractoriness</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >It is the ability of the molding material to resist the temperature of the liquid metal to be poured so that it does not get fused with the metal. The refractoriness of the silica sand is highest. </p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Permeability</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >During pouring and subsequent solidification of a casting, a large amount of gases and steam is generated. These gases are those that have been absorbed by the metal during melting, air absorbed from the atmosphere and the steam generated by the molding and core sand. If these gases are not allowed to escape from the mold, they would be entrapped inside the casting and cause casting defects. To overcome this problem the molding material must be porous. Proper venting of the mold also helps in escaping the gases that are generated inside the mold cavity.</p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Green Strength</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >The molding sand that contains moisture is termed as green sand. The green sand particles must have the ability to cling to each other to impart sufficient strength to the mold. The green sand must have enough strength so that the constructed mold retains its shape.</p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Dry Strength</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >When the molten metal is poured in the mold, the sand around the mold cavity is quickly converted into dry sand as the moisture in the sand evaporates due to the heat of the molten metal. At this stage the molding sand must posses the sufficient strength to retain the exact shape of the mold cavity and at the same time it must be able to withstand the metallostatic pressure of the liquid material. </p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Hot Strength</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >As soon as the moisture is eliminated, the sand would reach at a high temperature when the metal in the mold is still in liquid state. The strength of the sand that is required to hold the shape of the cavity is called hot strength.</p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Collapsibility</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >The molding sand should also have collapsibility so that during the contraction of the solidified casting it does not provide any resistance, which may result in cracks in the castings.Besides these specific properties the molding material should be cheap, reusable and should have good thermal conductivity.</p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Molding Sand Composition</b></p>
      <p class="style33"  >The main ingredients of any molding sand are:</p>
      <ul class="style33" >
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base sand, </li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binder, and </li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moisture</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Base Sand</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >Silica sand is most commonly used base sand. Other base sands that are also used for making mold are zircon sand, Chromite sand, and olivine sand. Silica sand is cheapest among all types of base sand and it is easily available. </p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Binder</b></p>
      <p class="style33"  >Binders are of many types such as:</p>
      <p class="style33"  >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay binders, </p>
      <p class="style33"  >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic binders and </p>
      <p class="style33"  >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inorganic binders</p>
      <p class="style33"  >Clay binders are most commonly used binding agents mixed with the molding sands to provide the strength. The most popular clay types are:</p>
      <p class="style33"  >Kaolinite or fire clay (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 2 SiO<sub>2</sub> 2 H<sub>2</sub>O) and Bentonite (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 4 SiO<sub>2</sub> nH<sub>2</sub>O)</p>
      <p class="style33"  >Of the two the Bentonite can absorb more water which increases its bonding power. </p>
      <p class="style33"  ><b>Moisture</b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style33"  >Clay acquires its bonding action only in the presence of the required amount of moisture. When water is added to clay, it penetrates the mixture and forms a microfilm, which coats the surface of each flake of the clay. The amount of water used should be properly controlled. This is because a part of the water, which coats the surface of the clay flakes, helps in bonding, while the remainder helps in improving the plasticity.
