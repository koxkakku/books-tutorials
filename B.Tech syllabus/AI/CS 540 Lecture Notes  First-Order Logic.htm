</P><H3>First-Order Logic (FOL or FOPC) Syntax</H3>
<UL>
<LI>User defines these primitives:
  <UL>
  <LI><B>Constant symbols</B> (i.e., the "individuals" in the world)
  E.g., Mary, 3
  </LI><LI><B>Function symbols</B> (mapping individuals to individuals)
  E.g., father-of(Mary) = John, color-of(Sky) = Blue
  </LI><LI><B>Predicate symbols</B> (mapping from individuals to truth values)
  E.g., greater(5,3), green(Grass), color(Grass, Green)
  </LI></UL><P>
</P></LI><LI>FOL supplies these primitives:
  <UL>
  <LI><B>Variable symbols</B>.  E.g., <TT>x</TT>, <TT>y</TT>
  </LI><LI><B>Connectives</B>.  Same as in PL: not (~), and (^), or (v), implies (=&gt;),
  if and only if (&lt;=&gt;)
  </LI><LI><B>Quantifiers</B>: Universal (<TT>A</TT>) and Existential (<TT>E</TT>)
    <UL>
    <LI>Universal quantification corresponds to conjunction ("and")
    in that <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> means that <TT>P</TT> holds for all values of <TT>x</TT> in the
    domain associated with that variable.  E.g., <TT>(Ax) dolphin(x) =&gt; mammal(x)</TT>
    </LI><LI>Existential quantification corresponds to disjunction ("or")
    in that <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> means that <TT>P</TT> holds for some value of <TT>x</TT> in the domain
    associated with that variable.  E.g., <TT>(Ex) mammal(x) ^ lays-eggs(x)</TT>
    </LI><LI>Universal quantifiers usually used with "implies" to form
    "if-then rules."  E.g., <TT>(Ax) cs540-student(x) =&gt; smart(x)</TT> means
    "All cs540 students are smart."  You rarely use universal quantification
    to make blanket statements about every individual in the world:
    <TT>(Ax)cs540-student(x) ^ smart(x)</TT> meaning that everyone in the world
    is a cs540 student and is smart.
    </LI><LI>Existential quantifiers usually used with "and" to specify a
    list of properties or facts about an individual.  E.g., 
    <TT>(Ex) cs540-student(x) ^ smart(x)</TT> means "there is a cs540 student who
    is smart."  A common mistake is to represent this English sentence
    as the FOL sentence: <TT>(Ex) cs540-student(x) =&gt; smart(x)</TT>
    But consider what happens when there is a person who is
    NOT a cs540-student.
    </LI><LI>Switching the order of universal quantifiers does not change
    the meaning: <TT>(Ax)(Ay)P(x,y)</TT> is logically equivalent to <TT>(Ay)(Ax)P(x,y)</TT>.
    Similarly, you can switch the order of existential quantifiers.
    </LI><LI>Switching the order of universals and existentials <I>does</I>
    change meaning:
    <UL>
    <LI>Everyone likes someone: <TT>(Ax)(Ey)likes(x,y)</TT>
    </LI><LI>Someone is liked by everyone: <TT>(Ey)(Ax)likes(x,y)</TT>
    </LI></UL>
    </LI></UL>
  </LI></UL><P>
</P></LI><LI>Sentences are built up from terms and atoms:
  <UL>
  <LI>A <B>term</B> (denoting a real-world individual) is
  a constant symbol, a variable symbol, or an n-place function of
  n terms.  For example, <I>x</I> and <I>f(x1, ..., xn)</I>
  are terms, where each <I>xi</I> is a term.
  </LI><LI>An <B>atom</B> (which has value true or false) is either
  an <TT>n</TT>-place predicate of <TT>n</TT> terms, or, if <TT>P</TT> and <TT>Q</TT> are atoms, then
  <TT>~P, P V Q, P ^ Q, P =&gt; Q, P &lt;=&gt; Q</TT> are atoms
  </LI><LI>A <B>sentence</B> is an atom, or, if <TT>P</TT> is a sentence and <TT>x</TT> is
  a variable, then <TT>(Ax)P</TT> and <TT>(Ex)P</TT> are sentences
  </LI><LI>A <B>well-formed formula (wff)</B> is a sentence containing
  no "free" variables.  I.e., all variables are "bound" by universal
  or existential quantifiers.  E.g., <TT>(Ax)P(x,y)</TT> has <TT>x</TT> bound as a
  universally quantified variable, but <TT>y</TT> is free.

</P><H3>Inference Rules for FOL</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Inference rules for PL apply to FOL as well.  For example,
Modus Ponens, And-Introduction, And-Elimination, etc.
</LI><LI>New (sound) inference rules for use with quantifiers:
<UL>
<LI><B>Universal Elimination</B><BR>
If <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> is true, then <TT>P(c)</TT> is true, where <TT>c</TT> is a constant in the
domain of <TT>x</TT>.  For example, from <TT>(Ax)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT> 
we can infer <TT>eats(Ziggy, IceCream)</TT>.  The variable symbol can be
replaced by any ground term, i.e., any constant symbol or function
symbol applied to ground terms only.
</LI><LI><B>Existential Introduction</B><BR>
If <TT>P(c)</TT> is true, then <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> is inferred.  For example,
from <TT>eats(Ziggy, IceCream)</TT> we can infer <TT>(Ex)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT>.
All instances of the given constant symbol are replaced by the new
variable symbol.  Note that the variable symbol cannot already
exist anywhere in the expression.
</LI><LI><B>Existential Elimination</B><BR>
From <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> infer <TT>P(c)</TT>.  For example, 
from <TT>(Ex)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT> infer <TT>eats(Ziggy, Cheese)</TT>.
Note that the variable is replaced by a <I>brand new</I> constant
that does not occur in this or <I>any other</I> sentence in
the Knowledge Base.  In other words, we don't want to accidentally
draw other inferences about it by introducing the constant.  All
we know is there must be <I>some</I> constant that makes this true,
so we can introduce a brand new one to stand in for that (unknown)
constant.
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI><B>Paramodulation</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Given two sentences <TT>(P1 v ... v PN)</TT> and <TT>(t=s v Q1 v ... v QM)</TT>
where each <TT>Pi</TT> and <TT>Qi</TT> is a literal (see definition below) and
<TT>Pj</TT> contains a term <TT>t</TT>,
derive new sentence 
<TT>(P1 v ... v Pj-1 v Pj[s] v Pj+1 v ... v PN v Q1 v ... v QM)</TT> 
where <TT>Pj[s]</TT> means a single occurrence of the term <TT>t</TT>
is replaced by the term <TT>s</TT> in <TT>Pj</TT>
</LI><LI>Example: From <TT>P(a)</TT> and <TT>a=b</TT> derive <TT>P(b)</TT>
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI><B>Generalized Modus Ponens (GMP)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Combines And-Introduction, Universal-Elimination, and Modus Ponens
</LI><LI>Example: from <TT>P(c), Q(c)</TT>, and <TT>(Ax)(P(x) ^ Q(x)) =&gt; R(x)</TT>, 
derive <TT>R(c)</TT>
</LI><LI>In general, given atomic sentences <TT>P1, P2, ..., PN</TT>, and
implication sentence <TT>(Q1 ^ Q2 ^ ... ^ QN) =&gt; R</TT>, where <TT>Q1, ..., QN</TT> and
<TT>R</TT> are atomic sentences, and <TT>subst(Theta, Pi) = subst(Theta, Qi)</TT>
for i=1,...,N, derive new sentence: <TT>subst(Theta, R)</TT>
</LI><LI><TT>subst(Theta, alpha)</TT> denotes the result of applying a set of
substitutions defined by <TT>Theta</TT> to the sentence <TT>alpha</TT>
</LI><LI>A substitution list <TT>Theta = {v1/t1, v2/t2, ..., vn/tn}</TT> means
to replace all occurrences of variable symbol <TT>vi</TT> by term <TT>ti</TT>.
Substitutions are made in left-to-right order in the list.
Example: <TT>subst({x/IceCream, y/Ziggy}, eats(y,x)) = eats(Ziggy, IceCream)</TT>

</P><H3>Automated Inference for FOL</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Automated inference using FOL is harder than using PL because
variables can take on potentially an infinite number of possible
values from their domain.  Hence there are potentially an
infinite number of ways to apply Universal-Elimination rule of
inference
</LI><LI>Godel's Completeness Theorem says that FOL entailment is only
semidecidable.  That is, if a sentence is true given a set of
axioms, there is a procedure that will determine this.  However,
if the sentence is false, then there is no guarantee that a
procedure will ever determine this.  In other words, the procedure
may never halt in this case.
</LI><LI>The Truth Table method of inference is not complete for FOL
because the truth table size may be infinite
</LI><LI>Natural Deduction is complete for FOL but is
not practical for automated inference because the "branching
factor" in a search is too large, caused by the fact that
we would have to potentially try every inference rule in every
possible way using the set of known sentences
</LI><LI>Generalized Modus Ponens is not complete for FOL
</LI><LI>Generalized Modus Ponens is complete for
KBs containing only <B>Horn clauses</B>
<UL>
<LI>A Horn clause is a sentence of the form:<BR>
<TT>(Ax) (P1(x) ^ P2(x) ^ ... ^ Pn(x)) =&gt; Q(x)</TT><BR>
where there are 0 or more <TT>Pi</TT>'s, and the <TT>Pi</TT>'s and <TT>Q</TT> are positive
(i.e., un-negated) literals
</LI><LI>Horn clauses represent a subset of the set of sentences
representable in FOL.  For example, <TT>P(a) v Q(a)</TT> is a sentence in FOL
but is not a Horn clause.
</LI><LI>Natural deduction using GMP is complete for KBs containing only
Horn clauses.  Proofs start with the given axioms/premises in KB,
deriving new sentences using GMP until the goal/query sentence is
derived.  This defines a <B>forward chaining</B> inference procedure
because it moves "forward" from the KB to the goal.  
<UL>
<LI>Example:  KB = All cats like fish, cats eat everything they
like, and Ziggy is a cat.  In FOL, KB =<BR>
<OL>
<LI><TT>(Ax) cat(x) =&gt; likes(x, Fish)</TT>
</LI><LI><TT>(Ax)(Ay) (cat(x) ^ likes(x,y)) =&gt; eats(x,y)</TT>
</LI><LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT>
</LI></OL>
<P>
Goal query: Does Ziggy eat fish?</P><P>
</P><P>
Proof:<BR>
</P><OL>
<LI>Use GMP with (1) and (3) to derive: 4. <TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT>
</LI><LI>Use GMP with (3), (4) and (2) to derive <TT>eats(Ziggy, Fish)</TT>
</LI><LI>So, Yes, Ziggy eats fish.
</LI></OL>
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI><B>Backward-chaining</B> deduction using GMP is complete for KBs containing
only Horn clauses.  Proofs start with the goal query, find implications
that would allow you to prove it, and then prove each of the antecedents
in the implication, continuing to work "backwards" until we get to the
axioms, which we know are true.
<UL>
<LI>Example: Does Ziggy eat fish?<P>
To prove <TT>eats(Ziggy, Fish)</TT>, first see if this is known from one of
the axioms directly.  Here it is not known, so see if there is a
Horn clause that has the consequent (i.e., right-hand side) of the
implication matching the goal.  Here,</P><P>

Proof:<BR>
</P><OL>
<LI>Goal matches RHS of Horn clause (2), so try and prove new sub-goals
<TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> and <TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> that correspond to the LHS of (2)
</LI><LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> matches axiom (3), so we've "solved" that sub-goal
</LI><LI><TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> matches the RHS of (1), so try and prove <TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT>
</LI><LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> matches (as it did earlier) axiom (3), so
we've solved this sub-goal
</LI><LI>There are no unsolved sub-goals, so we're done.  Yes, Ziggy eats fish.

</P><H3>Resolution Refutation Procedure (aka Resolution Procedure)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Proof by contradiction method
</LI><LI>Given a consistent set of axioms <TT>KB</TT> and goal sentence <TT>Q</TT>,
we want to show that <TT>KB |= Q</TT>.  This means that every interpretation <TT>I</TT>
that satisfies <TT>KB</TT>, satisfies <TT>Q</TT>.  But we know that any interpretation
<TT>I</TT> satisfies either <TT>Q</TT> or <TT>~Q</TT>, but not both.  Therefore if in fact
<TT>KB |= Q</TT>, an interpretation that
satisfies KB, satisfies <TT>Q</TT> and does not satisfy <TT>~Q</TT>.
Hence KB union {<TT>~Q</TT>} is unsatisfiable, i.e., that it's false
under all interpretations.
</LI><LI>In other words, <TT>(KB |- Q) &lt;=&gt; (KB ^ ~Q |- False)</TT>
</LI><LI>What's the gain?  If KB union <TT>~Q</TT> is unsatisfiable, then
some <I>finite</I> subset is unsatisfiable
</LI><LI>Resolution procedure can be used to establish that a given sentence <TT>Q</TT>
is entailed by KB; however, it <I>cannot</I>, in general, be used to generate
all logical consequences of a set sentences.  Also, the resolution procedure cannot
be used to prove that <TT>Q</TT> is <I>not</I> entailed by KB.
</LI><LI>Resolution procedure won't always give an answer since entailment
is only semidecidable.  And you can't just run two proofs in parallel,
one trying to prove <TT>Q</TT> and the other trying to prove <TT>~Q</TT>, since
KB might not entail either one.

</P><H3>Converting FOL Sentences to Clause Form</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Every FOL sentence can be converted to a logically equivalent
sentence that is in a "normal form" called <B>clause form</B>
</LI><LI>Steps to convert a sentence to clause form:
<OL>
<LI>Eliminate all <TT>&lt;=&gt;</TT> connectives by replacing each instance
of the form <TT>(P &lt;=&gt; Q)</TT> by the equivalent expression
<TT>((P =&gt; Q) ^ (Q =&gt; P))</TT>
</LI><LI>Eliminate all <TT>=&gt;</TT> connectives by replacing each instance
of the form <TT>(P =&gt; Q)</TT> by <TT>(~P v Q)</TT>
</LI><LI>Reduce the scope of each negation symbol to a single predicate
by applying equivalences such as converting <TT>~~P</TT> to <TT>P</TT>;
<TT>~(P v Q)</TT> to <TT>~P ^ ~Q</TT>; <TT>~(P ^ Q)</TT> to <TT>~P v ~Q</TT>;
<TT>~(Ax)P</TT> to <TT>(Ex)~P</TT>,
and <TT>~(Ex)P</TT> to <TT>(Ax)~P</TT>
</LI><LI>Standardize variables: rename all variables so that each
quantifier has its own unique variable name.  For example,
convert <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> to <TT>(Ay)P(y)</TT> if there is another place where
variable <TT>x</TT> is already used.
</LI><LI>Eliminate existential quantification by introducing
<B>Skolem functions</B>.  For example, convert <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> to <TT>P(c)</TT>
where <TT>c</TT> is a brand new constant symbol that is not used in any
other sentence.  <TT>c</TT> is called a <B>Skolem constant</B>.  More generally,
if the existential quantifier is within the scope of a universal
quantified variable, then introduce a Skolem function that

<TT>(Ax)(Ey)P(x,y)</TT> is converted to <TT>(Ax)P(x, f(x))</TT>.  
<TT>f</TT> is called a

</P><H3>Resolution Procedure as Search through a Search Space</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Resolution procedure can be thought of as the bottom-up construction of a 
search tree, where the leaves are the clauses produced by KB and
the negation of the goal.  When a pair of clauses generates a
new resolvent clause, add a new node to the tree with arcs directed
from the resolvent to the two parent clauses.  The resolution procedure succeeds
when a node
containing the <I>False</I> clause is produced, becoming the root node
of the tree.
</LI><LI>A strategy is complete if its use guarantees that the empty
clause (i.e., <TT>false</TT>) can be derived whenever it is entailed
</LI><LI>Some Strategies for Controlling Resolution's Search
<UL>
<LI>Breadth-First
<UL>
<LI>Level 0 clauses are those from the original axioms and the
negation of the goal.  Level k clauses are the resolvents computed
from two clauses, one of which must be from level k-1 and the other
from any earlier level.
</LI><LI>Compute all level 1 clauses possible, then all possible level 2
clauses, etc.
</LI><LI>Complete, but very inefficient.
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI>Set-of-Support
<UL>
<LI>At least one parent clause must be from the negation of the goal
or one of the "descendents" of such a goal clause (i.e., derived from
a goal clause)
</LI><LI>Complete (assuming all possible set-of-support clauses are derived)
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI>Unit Resolution
<UL>
<LI>At least one parent clause must be a "unit clause," i.e.,
a clause containing a single literal
</LI><LI>Not complete in general, but complete for Horn clause KBs
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI>Input Resolution
<UL>
<LI>At least one parent from the set of original clauses (from the
axioms and the negation of the goal)
</LI><LI>Not complete in general, but complete for Horn clause KBs
